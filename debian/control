Description: WebOb provides objects for HTTP requests and responses.
 The request and response objects provide many conveniences for
 parsing HTTP request and forming HTTP responses. Both objects are
 read/write: as a result, WebOb is also a nice way to create HTTP
 requests and parse HTTP responses.
